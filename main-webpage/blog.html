        <p>In a world increasingly filled with more and more sushi, how can you make sure that you always get the quality that you deserve? This simple answer is to ALWAYS get your sushi from Dev Ops Sushi. But why is this? Let's find out!
        <br>
        <br>
        First and foremost is our commitment to always serving the freshest possible sushi. All of our sushi is purchased from the most experienced fisherman and is always served on the same day which it is cought. This helps us insure the best possible quality!
        <br>
        <br>
        Another way in which we insure our quality is by our use of master chefs. All of our chefs have trained and apprenticed for at least 50 years on on the island of Japan to insure that there sushi preparation skills our up to our standards.
        <br>
        <br>
        The final way which we insure quality is through "service with a smile". Although food is about... well... the food -- we believe that its also important to provide the best possible dining experience. Because, how can you possibly enjoy the food if you're not happy?

			Is Japan's sushi really better? Our answer to that question is: Absolutely yes!
			<br>
	        <br>
			It is for this reason that each of the three founders have spent over 20 years studying sushi in Japan from aclaimed master chefs. Our training has tought ancient sushi techniques that include everything from catching the fish to preparing each individual role with care and expertise.
			<br>
	        <br>
			We believe that this experience is reflected in the sushi that we serve and we hope that you enjoy fantastic sushi that we produce as a result.
