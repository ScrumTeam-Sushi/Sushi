SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS

To build a successful business, we plan to leverage social media in order to reach out to the community. We hope to build connections with our patrons 

We plan to use the following social media outlets:

1. Facebook
We would like to create a facebook page with information about our Sushi business as well as advertising to entice people place more order and increase awareness about our business.

2. Twitter
We hope to be just as prevalent (and savage) as @Wendys.

3. Instagram
We hope to post beautiful photos of the sushi rolls that our chefs create in order to entice people to order our food.
